Sometimes you'll find laptops with an SSD with NVMe to run the operating system but an older SATA drive to store files. This gives you the best of both worlds: speed where you need it, but still budget-friendly. |
| A          | Screen size       |                      |            |                | 16:9 ratio                            |                  | 14-15 inch | The ratio impacts the size of the screen. A 14 inch screen with a 16:9 ratio is bigger than a 14 inch screen with a 4:3 ratio.                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Other Considerations
- Touchscreen is very battery-intensive. Not really useful since you have an iPad
