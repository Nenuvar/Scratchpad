Your Ideal App Installation Setup on Linux Lite

**Use .deb files when available (simple, GUI-friendly)**
- Just double-click and install with GDebi (already installed on Linux Lite).
- You get menu integration automatically.
- Easy to remove via terminal or Synaptic.

**Use apt for anything in the official repos**
- Terminal command:
`sudo apt install name-of-app`
- Example:
`sudo apt install vlc`

**Add Flatpak (optional but powerful)**
- One-time setup:
```
sudo apt install flatpak
sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```
- Then install anything with:
```
flatpak install flathub md.obsidian.Obsidian
```
- Menu entries show up automatically, and apps are sandboxed.

### So What Should You Use?
Use **.deb** or apt first — simple, native, stable.

Add **Flatpak** if you want access to newer versions or apps not in the repo (like Obsidian).

**Skip AppImages** for now unless you’re testing or it’s the only option.
