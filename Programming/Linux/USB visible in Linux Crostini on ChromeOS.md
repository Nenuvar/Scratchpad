Plug in the USB

Share it with Linux

Go to Settings > About > Linux Development Environment > Manage USB Devices

Toggle on permission for Linux apps to access USB devices

The name of the USB should be listed

In Linux, run this command:
`lsblk`

This will list your USB as sda (or sdb, or another name if you have several devices connected).
